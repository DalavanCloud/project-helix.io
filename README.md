# project-helix.io

Project Helix documentation site based onâ€¦ Helix!

Check [www.project-helix.io](http://www.project-helix.io/index.html).

## Installation

Clone current repo and simply run `hlx up`.

If you want to see content from remote repository, run `git submodule init`

If you want to locally emulate the behaviors on the public host (especially when working with navigation links, multiple content repos with one code repo...), use:

```bash
hlx up --host www.project-helix.io
```

## Deployment and publication

### Setup

Ensure that you have the correct environment variable defined.:

```bash
$ source secrets/helix.env
$ printenv  | fgrep HLX_
HLX_WSK_NAMESPACE=helix
HLX_WSK_AUTH=...
HLX_FASTLY_NAMESPACE=...
HLX_FASTLY_AUTH=...
```

If the `secrets/helix.env` is missing, you need to decrypt the first.
We're using [blackbox](https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox) to encrypt the secrets. Follow
the installation instructions if needed.

Once you added yourself as an admin and committed the changes, one of the other admin will need to re-encrypted the files. Check the list of admins in [.blackbox/blackbox-admins.txt](.blackbox/blackbox-admins.txt) and contact them. Then you will be able to run:

```bash
blackbox_decrypt_all_files
```

### Deploy

```bash
hlx deploy --default REPO_RAW_ROOT https://raw.githubusercontent.com --default REPO_API_ROOT https://api.github.com/
```

### Publish

```bash
hlx publish
```
